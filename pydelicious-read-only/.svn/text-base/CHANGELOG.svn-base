    Lots of cosmetic changes in formatting, documentation.
    Slight update to some methods for hashes/meta params.

    Feedparser is now optional.

    Now raises Exceptions for API errors. Methods do no longer return {'result:..}
    data. May break existing code.

    every request. This opener now also handles 503 (throttled) and 401 (unauthorized).
    Numerous cosmetic, formatting changes, slight fixes, etc.
